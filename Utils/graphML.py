    LSIGF(filter_taps, GSO, input, bias=None) Computes the output of a linear
        shift-invariant graph filter on input and then adds bias.

    Denote as G the number of input features, F the number of output features,
    E the number of edge features, K the number of filter taps, N the number of
    nodes, S_{e} in R^{N x N} the GSO for edge feature e, x in R^{G x N} the
    input data where x_{g} in R^{N} is the graph signal representing feature
    g, and b in R^{F x N} the bias vector, with b_{f} in R^{N} representing the
    bias for feature f.

    Then, the LSI-GF is computed as
        y_{f} = \sum_{e=1}^{E}
                    \sum_{k=0}^{K-1}

                + b_{f}
    for f = 1, ..., F.

    Inputs:
        filter_taps (torch.tensor): array of filter taps; shape:
            output_features x edge_features x filter_taps x input_features
        GSO (torch.tensor): graph shift operator; shape:

        input (torch.tensor): input signal; shape:
            batch_size x input_features x number_nodes
        bias (torch.tensor): shape: output_features x number_nodes
            if the same bias is to be applied to all nodes, set number_nodes = 1
            so that b_{f} vector becomes b_{f} \mathbf{1}_{N}
